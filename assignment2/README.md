# Image Denoising and Enhancement Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various image denoising and enhancement techniques for 12-bit RAW images. The goal of this project is to apply and compare methods such as AI-based denoising, median filtering, bilateral filtering, and edge enhancement techniques using a Laplacian filter. The output is a 24-bit RGB image, suitable for further processing and analysis.

## Evaluation Metrics

## Spatial Signal-to-Noise Ratio Calculation

### Overview
In this section, we compute the **Spatial Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR)** for three different gray tones using various denoising and enhancement methods implemented in this project. We will also apply edge enhancement techniques, including the **Laplacian filter**, and compare the results with previous methods implemented in Assignment 2.

### Methods Implemented
1. **Laplacian Filter for Edge Enhancement**
   - The Laplacian filter is used to enhance edges in an image. It calculates the second derivative of the image, highlighting areas of rapid intensity change.
   
2. **Denoising Techniques Compared**
   - **Median Filter:** Reduces noise by replacing each pixel's value with the median value of the pixels in its neighborhood.
   - **Bilateral Filter:** Preserves edges while smoothing out noise by considering both spatial and intensity differences.
   - **Gaussian Filter:** Smooths the image by averaging pixel values, which may blur edges.
   - **Edge Enhancement (from Assignment 2):** A previous method that enhances edges, which we will compare against.

### Computation of SSNR
The formula for calculating the SSNR is given by:
 ```math
\text{SSNR} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{(R^2)}{MSE}\right)
```

Where:
-  $R\$ is the maximum possible pixel value (255 for 8-bit grayscale).
- $MSE\$ is the Mean Squared Error between the original and denoised images.

## Key Findings

### Filter Rankings (by PSNR)
1. Median Filter: 42.31 dB
2. AI Denoised: 40.06 dB
3. Gaussian: 38.98 dB
4. Bilateral: 37.92 dB
5. Laplacian: 28.39 dB

### Edge Preservation Analysis
- **Best Edge Retention**: Median Filter (211.09)
